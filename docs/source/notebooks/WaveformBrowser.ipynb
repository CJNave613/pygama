    "# Browsing waveforms with the `WaveformBrowser`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a tutorial demonstrating several ways to use the `WaveformBrowser` to examine waveform data. This will consist of multiple examples, increasing in complexity, and will use LEGEND test data from [legend-testdata](https://github.com/legend-exp/legend-testdata). The `WaveformBrowser` [[docs]](https://pygama.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pygama.vis.html#pygama.vis.waveform_browser.WaveformBrowser) is a pygama utility for accessing waveforms from raw files in an interactive way, enabling you to access, draw, or even process waveforms. Some use cases for this utility include investigating a population of waveforms, and debugging waveform processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need a waveform browser when we can access data via Pandas dataframes? Pandas dataframes work extremely well for reading tables of simple values from multiple HDF5 files. However, they are less optimal for waveforms. The reason for this is that they require holding all waveforms in memory at once. If we want to look at waveforms spread out across multiple files, this can potentially take up GBs of memory, which will cause problems! To get around this, we want to load only bits of the files into memory at a time and pull out only what we need. Since this is an inconvenient process, the `WaveformBrowser` will do this for you, while hiding the details as much as possible.\n",
